# Stay updated & contribute

The Awesome GEE Community Catalog is created and maintained by [Samapriya Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samapriya/) with data, examples, tutorial contributions from our community. This is a community common meaning it needs involvement to survive as a grassroots open source project. Here are some ways in which you can get involved with this project and check out examples on how you can bring data, examples, bug reports and pull requests to the catalog here. Open up a Github discussion and create a pull request if you notice any issues so I can fix them. **Sign Up for Updates:** Never miss the latest catalog additions and in-depth explorations by subscribing to catalog updates [through out datacommons blog](https://datacommons.substack.com).
