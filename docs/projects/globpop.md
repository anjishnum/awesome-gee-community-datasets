# GlobPOP Global Gridded Population Dataset

GlobPOP is a continuous high-resolution global gridded population dataset covering the period from 1990 to 2020 with annual time steps. Developed by the State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science at Beijing Normal University, this dataset provides population count and density information at a 30 arc-second (approximately 1 km at the equator) resolution. GlobPOP is derived from a data fusion framework based on cluster analysis and statistical learning approaches, which integrates five existing global gridded population datasets: GHS-POP, GRUMP, GPWv4, LandScan, and WorldPop. The fusion methodology enhances consistency for time-series analysis through spatial-temporal validation, making it particularly valuable for applications in sustainable development, epidemiology, urban planning, environmental management, risk assessment, and tracking progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

#### Notes

!!! info

    - GlobPOP offers high spatial and temporal consistency for time-series analysis of population dynamics
    - The dataset provides both population count (persons per grid cell) and density (persons per square kilometer)
    - The product was validated at both national (217 countries) and sub-national levels using census data
    - The dataset is particularly useful for analyzing long-term population changes and spatial patterns at global, national, and city levels
