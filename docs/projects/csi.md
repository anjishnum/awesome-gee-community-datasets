# Carbon Security Index

This dataset presents an index developed to assess carbon security across the sagebrush steppe in the Great Basin. The Carbon Security Index (CSI) incorporates data from three key sources: fractional plant cover from the [Rangeland Analysis Platform](https://rangelands.app/), a fire probability model specific to the Great Basin (Smith et al., 2023), and a resistance and resilience dataset for the sagebrush steppe (Chambers et al., 2014, 2017).

The CSI is calculated as follows:

**CSI = Preferred Rangeland Cover Index + Resistance & Resilience â€“ P(Fire)**

The resulting index ranges from -2 to +2 and allows for spatial comparisons of carbon security across the region.
