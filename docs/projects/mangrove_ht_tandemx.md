# Global Mangrove Canopy Height Maps Derived from TanDEM-X

???+ note

    **This paper is currently in review with Nature Scientific Data and the citation will be updated once the paper has been published. Please keep this into consideration while using this dataset**

This dataset provides global mangrove canopy height maps for 2015 at a 12-meter resolution. Canopy height estimates were derived from the TanDEM-X digital surface models, calibrated and validated with GEDI Lidar data. The dataset covers a circum-equatorial band from 34 degrees north to 39 degrees south latitude, encompassing the majority of mangrove ecosystems globally. The dataset includes 1443 GeoTIFF files containing global mangrove canopy height maps organized into 1째 by 1째 tiles. Each GeoTIFF file represents a single tile and is named as follows: `TDM1_DEM__10_Y##X###_DEM_EGM08_GMW314_2015_WM_hcap_cal.tif`, where `Y##X###` represents the latitude (Y = "N" or "S") and longitude (X = "W" or "E") coordinates of the tile's southwest corner.

These canopy height maps are useful for assessing local-scale geophysical and environmental conditions that regulate forest structure and carbon cycle dynamics in mangrove ecosystems. These canopy height maps are instrumental for assessing local-scale geophysical and environmental conditions that regulate forest structure and carbon cycle dynamics in mangrove ecosystems.

#### Data acquisition and materials
For data acquisition and materials, the sources included Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from the German Aerospace Agency (DLR) TanDEM-X mission, as reported by Rizzoli et al. in 2017. The Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) map provided a global mangrove extent map, as detailed by Bunting et al. in 2022. Additionally, Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L2A data was used, as documented by Dubayah et al. in 2020.

#### Data Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|---|---|
| Spatial Coverage | Circum-equatorial band from 34째 N to 39째 S |
| Spatial Resolution | 12 m |
| Temporal Coverage | Mangrove height maps: 2015; GEDI L2A mangrove heights: 2019-04-18 to 2022-05-22 |
| Temporal Resolution | One-time estimates for nominal year 2015 of maximum canopy height. GEDI data were collected between April 2019 and May 2022. |
| Data File Formats | Cloud optimized GeoTIFF (.tif) and CSV (*.csv) |
| Number of Files | 1443 GeoTIFF files and 1 CSV file |

#### GeoTIFF Characteristics

* Coordinate system: geographic coordinates using WGS 1984 datum with elevation (EPSG: 4979)
* Pixel resolution: 0.000111 degrees (~12 m)
* Number of bands: one
* Pixel values: maximum canopy height in meters
* No data value: All pixels are valid, but pixels without mangroves have a value of zero.

The `GEDI_MANGROVE_HT`, layer contains mangrove heights for individual GEDI L2A tiles used to generate the GeoTIFF files.
