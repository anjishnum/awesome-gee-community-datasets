# Global Annual Simulated NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light Dataset (1992-2023)

The SVNL (Simulated VIIRS Nighttime Light) dataset provides a harmonized, continuous global annual NPP-VIIRS-like nighttime light data from 1992 to 2023. The longest available consistent NPP-VIIRS-like nighttime light dataset spanning over 32 years through cross-sensor calibration and deep learning methods.This dataset addresses critical gaps in existing nighttime light data by bridging DMSP-OLS (1992-2013) and NPP-VIIRS (2012-2023) through an innovative deep learning approach using a Nighttime Light U-Net super-resolution network (NTLSRU-Net).

The dataset features temporal coverage from 1992-2023 (32 years) with a spatial resolution of 15 arc-seconds (~500m). It provides global coverage from -180째 to 180째 longitude and 65째S to 75째N latitude. The data maintains consistent calibration across DMSP-OLS and VIIRS sensors while providing enhanced spatial detail comparable to NPP-VIIRS and reduced saturation and blooming effects compared to raw DMSP data. The dataset has been extensively validated against socioeconomic indicators and existing nighttime light datasets.

The dataset enables long-term analysis of urbanization monitoring, socioeconomic estimation, environmental assessment, human activity patterns, and regional and global development studies. This comprehensive temporal coverage makes it particularly valuable for studying long-term urban development, economic growth patterns, and environmental changes at both regional and global scales.

#### Methods

The dataset was generated through:
1. Preprocessing of raw DMSP-OLS data to address interannual inconsistency
2. Cross-sensor calibration using NTLSRU-Net with Landsat NDVI assistance
3. Integration of simulated VIIRS data (1992-2011) with real VIIRS data (2012-2023)
4. Comprehensive validation across multiple scales and metrics

#### Dataset Preprocessing
Original data was not compression optimized , an LZW compression with tiling  was applied to convert these into COG for direct use as well as being ingested into Google Earth Engine. Nodata value was coded as 0 the same as the authors.
