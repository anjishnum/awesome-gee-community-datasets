# Carbon Offset Project Boundaries

Nature-based climate solutions (NBS) have become an important component of  strategies aiming to reduce atmospheric CO2 and mitigate climate change impacts. Carbon offsets have emerged as one of the most widely implemented NBS strategies, however, these projects have also been criticized for exaggerating offsets. Verifying the efficacy of NBS-derived carbon offset is complicated by a lack of readily available geospatial boundary data. Herein, we detail methods and present a database of nature-based offset project boundaries. This database provides the locations of 575 NBS projects distributed across 55 countries. Geospatial boundaries were aggregated using a combination of scraping data from carbon project registries  (n=433, 75.3%) as well as manual georeferencing and digitization (n=127, 22.1%). Database entries include three varieties of carbon projects: avoided deforestation, afforestation, reforestation and re-vegetation, and improved forest management. An accuracy assessment of the georeferencing and digitizing process indicated a high degree of accuracy (intersection over union score of 0.98 +/- 0.015).

#### Database notes

- Users must carefully distinguish between overall project areas and project accounting areas based on their specific analysis requirements:
  * The **project area** is defined as the geographical area where the project participants implement activities to reduce deforestation.
  * The **project accounting area** is defined as the geographical area of the project that was used to calculate carbon credit issuance.

- This database does not represent a census of nature-based carbon projects and does not contain all varieties of nature-based carbon projects.

- Users should verify that any georeferencing inaccuracies will not significantly impact their analyses.

- The boundaries included in the database reflect the data available in the registries at the time of access, with some projects regularly updating their information.

- We note that we were unable to assess the accuracy of the boundaries constructed from linear features or from a developer provided protocol.
