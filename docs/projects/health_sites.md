# Global Healthsites Mapping Project

Healthsites.io and the Global Healthsites Mapping Project's mission is to help supply governments, NGOs, and the private sector with accurate and up-to-date health facility information. Health facility registers are the building blocks of a well-functioning health information system within a country. Accurate and up-to-date data provides the basic data that helps drive activities like service availability planning, monitoring and evaluation, and disaster risk preparedness.

The data is shared on both https://healthsites.io and expected a monthly updated on the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/organization/healthsites). Expected update Frequency for now is every month. Read the Healthsites concept note http://bit.ly/2ocL2KY

The healthsites.io datasets are served as nodes (defining points in space) and ways (defining linear features and area boundaries) based on open street map object relations.
