# Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) 2024

The Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) dataset is developed and owned by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). It provides a comprehensive spatial dataset of sub-national administrative units for all countries in the world, consistent with the United Nations (UN) delineation of international boundaries.

GAUL 2024 includes two datasets: GAUL 2024 Subnational Level 1 (GAUL_2024_L1) and GAUL 2024 Subnational Level 2 (GAUL_2024_L2). The dataset was developed by consolidating national-level data from relevant sources, which involved editing geometries, standardizing attributes into a unified table structure, and preparing metadata for each country. You can find [the technical documentation here](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/a400ec42-9ca7-46a3-a0ce-256de7d5ca94/content)

#### Data Sources

GAUL 2024 was compiled from multiple sources in order of priority:

1. Second Administrative Level Boundaries (SALB) geoportal - authoritative subnational boundary information managed by the UN Geographic Information Section
2. Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform - hosted by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
3. National Providers - relevant national authorities identified through online research or FAO national representations
4. GAUL 2015 - used when no other data sources were available

#### Technical Details

- Coordinate System: WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
- Data structure: Seamless and topologically corrected geometries
- Coding system: Unique numeric codes within and across administrative levels
  - Country (level 0): 100-999
  - Level 1 unit: 1,000-99,999
  - Level 2 unit: 100,000-899,999
  - Waterbody: 900,000-999,000

!!! note
    - GAUL 2024 should not be considered an authoritative or official representation of subnational boundaries. Its primary objective is to facilitate the representation of subnational statistics and attributes.
    - Country names in GAUL 2024 follow the Names of Countries and Territories (NOCS) database.
    - The dataset adopts the Latin alphabet to represent place names in their native languages, preserving accents and diacritics where applicable.
    - Some administrative units may be labeled as "Administrative unit not available" when the data is not available.
    - Waterbodies are included with unique code IDs greater than 900,000.
