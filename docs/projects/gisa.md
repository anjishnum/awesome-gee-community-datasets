# Global Impervious Surface Area (1972-2021)

The Global Impervious Surface Area (GISA) dataset provides comprehensive 30-meter resolution mapping of impervious surfaces worldwide. The latest version, GISA-new (1972-2021), addresses omission and commission errors in previous versions by implementing advanced algorithms including a multi-temporal Continuous Change Detection and Classification (NA-CCDC) method and a multi-scale iterative algorithm (MIA). With these improvements, GISA-new achieves the highest overall accuracy (93.12%), lowest omission errors (10.50%), and lowest commission errors (3.52%) among global ISA datasets.

GISA was originally developed using more than three million Landsat satellite images. The original version (1972-2019) provided global ISA maps with a time span from 1972â€“2019 and achieved high accuracy (F-score of 0.954). The new version extends coverage to 2021 and significantly improves accuracy in challenging areas including rural and arid regions.

    **GISA-new Improvements:**

    - Reduced omission errors in low-density impervious surfaces (rural, suburban areas)
    - Removed commission errors from spectrally similar surfaces (bare soil, water bodies)
    - Improved accuracy in challenging regions (arid landscapes, rural settlements)
    - Expanded temporal coverage to 2021
    - Enhanced consistency across the time series
