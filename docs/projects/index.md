# Data Themes

![GEE Community Datasets](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/samapriya/34bc0c1280d475d3a69e3b60a706226e/raw/community.json)

The Awesome GEE (Google Earth Engine) Community Catalog is a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and environmental scientists. It organizes a diverse range of geospatial datasets into thematic groups, making them more accessible and findable. This structured approach allows users to efficiently locate datasets pertinent to their specific fields of study or interest.

!!! tip "Insiders Program and Insiders only datasets"

    **Some datasets are part of the Insiders only datasets and they [can be found here](https://gee-community-catalog.org/insiders). The insiders program is designed for those who are helping keep open source projects sustainable and support the growth and curation of the catalog. The Insiders Program grants access to a few special selection of datasets. You can be part of the program click on the link :point_up: to find out more.**

#### Thematic Groups
The datasets in the Awesome GEE Community Catalog are categorized into several thematic groups, for example:

* Population and Socioeconomic Datasets: These datasets provide crucial information on demographics, economic activities, and social indicators, which are essential for urban planning, public health, and socio-economic research.

* Hydrology Datasets: This category includes data on water bodies, hydrological cycles, and water quality, supporting research and decision-making in water resource management, flood risk assessment, and environmental conservation.

* Global Land Use and Land Cover Datasets: These datasets offer insights into land use patterns and changes in land cover over time, aiding studies in agriculture, forestry, urbanization, and climate change.

* Climate and Weather Datasets: Essential for climate science, these datasets include historical and real-time data on weather patterns, temperature, precipitation, and other climatic factors.

    **While every effort has been made to place datasets in the most suitable thematic groups, it is acknowledged that some datasets may rightfully belong to more than one category. Users are encouraged to explore multiple themes if their research spans across different areas.**

#### Accessibility and Findability
The thematic grouping of datasets in the Awesome GEE Community Catalog enhances their accessibility and findability. By organizing datasets into clearly defined categories, the catalog simplifies the process of searching and identifying relevant data. This organization not only saves time but also ensures that users can easily locate the most appropriate datasets for their specific needs with the changelog recording periodic updates.
