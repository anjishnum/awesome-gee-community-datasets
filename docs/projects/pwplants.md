# Global Power Plant Database

#### release version: 1.3, release date: 2021-06-02

The Global Power Plant Database is an open-source open-access dataset of grid-scale (1 MW and greater) electricity generating facilities operating across the world.

The Database currently contains nearly 35000 power plants in 167 countries, representing about 72% of the world's capacity. Entries are at the facility level only, generally defined as a single transmission grid connection point.
Generation unit-level information is not currently available.

* The methodology for the dataset creation is given in the World Resources Institute publication ["A Global Database of Power Plants"](https://www.wri.org/research/global-database-power-plants).
* Associated code for the creation of the dataset can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database).
* See also the technical note published in early 2020 on an improved methodology to [estimate annual generation](https://www.wri.org/publication/estimating-power-plant-generation-global-power-plant-database).
