## Building the Future of Open Geospatial Science

Our vision extends beyond simple discussion threads. The forum will directly shape the catalog's evolution through:

- **Community-Driven Dataset Requests**: Propose and vote on new dataset priorities
- **Collaborative Documentation Projects**: Create next-generation tutorials combining multiple contributors' expertise
- **Open Peer Review System**: Improve data quality through transparent dataset evaluations
- **Project Incubator**: Find team members and resources for ambitious Earth observation initiatives
