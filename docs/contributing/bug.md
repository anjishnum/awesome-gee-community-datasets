# Bug report for dataset in community catalog

Bug reports are useful information for the catalog. This can range for anything from a spelling mistake that breaks integration to change in asset path that may not have been updated in the documentation for example, incorrect doucentation or citation reference and many more. These are different from dataset updates as they do not pertain to availability of updated data or release information.
