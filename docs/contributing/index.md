# Community Actions (Building the Catalog)

The Awesome GEE Community Catalog is an actively maintained and evolving project that serves a diverse user base with versatile backgrounds and needs. To efficiently address the requirements of all our users, evaluate change requests, and fix bugs, update datasets, I put in a lot of work and your contributions are helpful.The catalog is a collaborative effort, and I welcome your contributions! This catalog aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date list of community-driven datasets readily accessible within Google Earth Engine (GEE).

The Awesome GEE Community Catalog thrives on community contributions! Whether you've found a valuable dataset, spotted an error, or have a helpful tip to share, there are many ways to get involved. By contributing, you're not only helping us build a valuable resource for the GEE community, but you're also making it easier for others to find and utilize valuable Earth observation data.

## **How you can contribute**

I know your time is valuable. That's why I've streamlined contributing to the Awesome GEE Community Catalog!

* Clear Guides and Templates: I offer clear instructions and templates for reporting bugs, requesting changes, and participating in discussions. This saves you time by making sure your contributions are well-organized and easy for me to understand.
* Focus on Finding, Not Formatting: I've designed the issue tracker and discussion board for easy navigation and search. This means you can spend less time formatting your contributions and more time focusing on the valuable information you're sharing.
* Faster Support: By following my guidelines, you help me process your contributions quickly and efficiently. This means you get the help or support you need faster.
