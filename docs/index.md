The awesome-gee-community-catalog is an **unfunded open source grassroots project** with a mission to help collect **community sourced** and **community generated** geospatial datasets. Our goal is to make data **accessible** and tie it to an analysis platform **fostering accessibility** and **reducing digital divide**. This catalog lives and serves alongside the [Google Earth Engine data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog). This collaborative effort not only offers openly available, preprocessed research datasets but also caters to frequently requested ones under various open licenses. **Stay updated by signing up for email updates, ensuring you receive the latest catalog news and in-depth explorations of valuable data.**
