Welcome to the Awesome GEE Community Catalog, a comprehensive resource for discovering and contributing geospatial datasets designed for use with Google Earth Engine. The awesome-gee-community-catalog is an **unfunded open source grassroots project** with a mission to help collect **community sourced** and **community generated** geospatial datasets. Our goal is to make data **accessible** and tie it to an analysis platform **fostering accessibility** and **reducing digital divide**.

The catalog was created by and maintained by [Dr. Samapriya Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samapriya/) and this is currently a one person team. A [Google Developer Expert for Google Earth Engine](https://g.dev/samapriya) and Senior Product Manager at MAXAR,an [open source developer](https://github.com/samapriya) and a Geospatial Consultant & Speaker. Dr. Roy leads Developer Relations and champions open data access. Leveraging geospatial expertise as an affiliate faculty at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa and a Designated Campus Colleague at the University of Arizona, Dr. Roy further drives the mission of the catalog.

The catalog is further a result of data requests and tutorial contributions from the **#awesome** community who use the community catalog and input, advise and feedback from community members. Our mission is to make geospatial data accessible and analysis-ready, fostering collaboration and reducing the digital divide. The Awesome GEE Community Catalog thrives on community participation and open-source principles. We aim to build on creating accessibility to high-quality geospatial data, enabling researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to leverage these resources for their projects. This year the [National Science Foundation (NSF) ACCESS program](https://access-ci.org/) granted us 1.5 million Service Units or CPU Core hours to continue the work on the catalog through [**Jestream2 a NSF project**](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) which allow us to preprocess the datasets as requests are made.

## Community Contributions
Our catalog is powered by the contributions of the GEE user base. Community members submit datasets that are then reviewed, usually downloaded and preprocess and made Earth Engine ready and finally added to the catalog for everyone to use. This collaborative approach ensures a diverse and rich collection of data, covering a wide range of topics from waterbodies and population distribution to drought monitoring and more. Each contribution helps expand our repository, making it a go-to resource for geospatial data. üîç

## Update Schedule
We understand the importance of keeping datasets current and reliable. While some datasets are regularly updated on a fixed cadence, others follow a more ad hoc schedule. Updates are made as requests come in or as additional information becomes available about a dataset. This flexible approach allows us to respond to the community's needs and maintain the relevance and accuracy of the data we provide. üóìÔ∏è

**We rely on users to spread the word and share the catalog with other users. Please cite and attribute the catalog [using our citation](http://gee-community-catalog.org/reference/) making this project more visible and relevant.**
